title: the patronage?

tier 1 house has 1 slot
t2: 2 slots 
t3: 3 slots 

slots are building materials 
eg
- wood
- stone
- metal
- plastic
- fur
- etc

if house is made only of wood then can burn down, if a t3 house of WSS "burns down" it is not as affected
different materials give different benifits
higher tiers have larger capacity?
